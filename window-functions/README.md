This folder contains practice exercises and case studies focused on SQL Window Functions.

*"How to analyze trends and rankings without collapsing rows"*

```sql
-- Example: calculates a running total of ride durations
-- for each start terminal, ordered by start time
SELECT
  start_terminal,
  duration_seconds,
  SUM(duration_seconds) OVER (PARTITION BY start_terminal ORDER BY start_time) AS running_total
FROM dc_bikeshare;
```

## ðŸ’¡ Business Applications Examples
1. **User Retention**: Perform cohort analysis and track behavior over time using date-based partitions.
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare group-level metrics and windowed averages or ranks.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Spot outliers and unexpected shifts using NTILE-based ranks and moving averages.
4. **Revenue Trends**: Calculate running totals or average revenue over time to identify growth patterns or seasonality.
